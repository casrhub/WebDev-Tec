## World's Ugliest Page

The primary objective of this project is to showcase CSS and JavaScript, 
in an intentionall unattractive layout to emphasize CSS manipulation. Despite its intentionally unpleasant appearance, the functionality remains intersting and usefull. 
The [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) is leveraged to furnish information regarding specific rocket launches via a designated ID. 
Subsequently, the description is passed as an argument to a function that utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT to enhance the response from the SpaceX API, 
culminating in a more insightful description of the rocket launch.
